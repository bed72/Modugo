/// A set of module types that have been registered globally,
/// used to ensure the same module is not bound more than once.
final Set<Type> _modulesRegistered = {};

/// Abstract base class for a "module" (feature) within the application.
///
/// A [Module] defines:
/// - [imports()]: other modules it depends on. The `binds()` of imported
///   modules are executed before the current module's `binds()`.
/// - [routes()]: the route tree exposed by this module (e.g., [child],
///   [module], [shell], [statefulShell]).
/// - [binds()]: registers the module's dependencies in [GetIt] (via [i]).
///
/// Behavior:
/// - When [configureRoutes()] is called, the framework registers — **only once
///   per module type** — the `binds()` of the current module **and** all
///   imported modules, then sets up the route list.
/// - Dependency registration is idempotent: if a module has already been
///   registered, its `binds()` will not be executed again.
/// - Even if a module does not expose its own routes, if it appears in
///   [imports()], its `binds()` will still be executed.
///
/// Customization:
/// - Use [initState()] and [dispose()] to manage the module's internal state if
///   necessary.
/// - The injection instance is accessible via [i] (shortcut to
///   `GetIt.instance`).
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// class AppModule extends Module {
///   @override
///   List<IBinder> imports() => [SharedModule()];
///
///   @override
///   List<IRoute> routes() => [
///     route(path: '/', child: (context, state) => const HomePage()),
///   ];
///
///   @override
///   Future<void> binds() {
///     i
///       ..registerLazySingleton<HomeController>(() => HomeController())
///       ..registerSingleton<ApiClient>(ApiClient());
///   }
/// }
/// ```

  ///
  /// Use this method to perform any setup required when the module
  /// becomes active, such as initializing internal state, registering
  /// listeners, or preparing resources.
  ///
  /// This method is automatically called by the framework when the
  /// module is first instantiated or when its routes become active.

  /// module is no longer needed or when its routes are removed from
  /// the navigation stack.
  ///
  /// **Important:** Subclasses should call `super.dispose()` if they
  /// override this method to ensure that all module-level resources,
  /// including event channels and subscriptions, are properly released.

  /// - creating and combining child, shell, and module routes
  /// - optionally logging the final set of registered route paths when diagnostics are enabled
  ///
  /// Returns a combined list of all routes defined by this module and its nested structures.

  /// - Prevents cyclic imports by keeping track of already-registered types.
  /// - Executes the [binds] method of each module to register its
